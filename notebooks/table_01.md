# Variables And Parameters For Cliodynamics Models

The following table covers possible variables and parameters, along with their possible interaction, from page 4 of [^dwm].

> Table 1 provides a possible, yet highly debatable, attempt to identify some time-dependent macro state variables (leftmost column) and how they might depend upon certain observed processes/events such as population growth, carrying capacity, high state costs, rebellions/wars, changes in political power, etc. Signs indicate whether the event/process might positively (+) or negatively (âˆ’) change the dynamics of the macro-variables. It is evident that there could be many more possible variables, and already the positive/negative influence modeling is difficult. This does not even address the matter of possible functional form relationships to express the model precisely.
