Typing in JAX

"When annotating JAX arrays in public API functions, we recommend using ArrayLike for array inputs, and Array for array outputs."

The TOML file originally had:

[model]
t0 = 0
t1 = 500
dt0 = 1

[variables]
init_N = 0.5
init_S = 0.0

[parameters]
init_p = 1
init_s = 10
init_k = 1
max_k = 4
c = 3
r = 0.02
beta = 0.4

but was changed to

t0 = 0
t1 = 500
dt0 = 1
init_N = 0.5
init_S = 0.0
init_p = 1
init_s = 10
init_k = 1
max_k = 4
c = 3
r = 0.02
beta = 0.4

since plainly it was much easier to verify
that the config was valid.
